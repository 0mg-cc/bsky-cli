usage: bsky engage [-h] [--dry-run] [--hours HOURS]
                   [--max-runtime-seconds MAX_RUNTIME_SECONDS]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --dry-run             Preview without posting
  --hours HOURS         Look back N hours (default: 12)
  --max-runtime-seconds MAX_RUNTIME_SECONDS
                        Abort after N seconds wall-clock

EXAMPLES:
  bsky engage                  # Engage with posts from last 12h
  bsky engage --hours 24       # Look back 24 hours
  bsky engage --dry-run        # Preview without posting

HOW IT WORKS:
  1. Fetches recent posts from accounts you follow
  2. Filters by quality (engagement, recency, conversation potential)
  3. Uses LLM to select posts and craft thoughtful replies
  4. Tracks conversations for follow-up
